DESCRIPTION
    path           from where the norm checker is launched
                   (if nothing, it's from where you are)

 --This norm checker will find inexistant errors if :
  - you make an error in a string/char between quotation marks,
  - in the 6 first lines, the biggest part of all verifications avoid the
    6 first lines of a file because it's supposed to be the
    header and nothing else,

WHAT IS CHECKED :
      - number of chars by line,
      - tabulations,
      - indentation,
      - missing or corrupted header,
      - comma(s),
      - number of lines in a function,
      - spaces at the end of a line,
      - spaces around '=',
      - space after 'while', 'if', 'for' and 'return',
      - frequents banned functions,
      - number of functions in a file,
      - comment(s) inside a function or header files.
